# Badge Busters
In order to make Simplon selection easier, Badge Busters (catch them all) enables to sum-up the Codecademy profiles of the candidates.

The process is in 2 steps :
* fetch and save profiles
* display the profiles in a table

If you wonder why, it's because you will probably consult them more often than you update them (and updating them takes some time ~10 minutes).


# How to use

## Save profiles
* Just copy the column from the Google Spreadsheet 'Candidatures' and paste it into the first text area.
* Check that all links are separated by a line return and are valid links (like https://www.codecademy.com/{username})
* Find a name for your promo (if already exists, it will be updated, otherwise it will be created)
* And click on 'Fetch'
* Wait (it may take some minutes) ...

Badge busters will fetch profiles on Codecademy.com and then save them int a Firebase database. To know how to fetch them, keep reading ...


## Fetch profiles
After a couple of minutes, profiles are saved and you can display them in a beautiful table. It's very easy :
* Fill the input with the name your selected before (warning: it's case sensitive)
* Click on 'GET PROMO !'
* Profiles will be displayed under seconds


# Why using an intermediate database ?
Parsing Codecademy profils takes some time (around 1 minute per profile). In order to avoir waiting 10 minutes each time you need to see the profiles, they are cached in a Firebase database. You can see the data the profiles have been updated in the column 'mis à jour le'.

# Api
* endpoint : http://badgebusters.simplon.xyz/api/profiles
* contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8"

## Post codecademy urls
To save (or update) a promo, the endpoint is
> http://badgebusters.simplon.xyz/api/profiles/{promoName}.

The body is a simple json { "links": [{ array of codecademy profile urls }] }.


For example,for a promo called *simplonmidipyrenees* , the
endpoint is
> http://badgebusters.simplon.xyz/api/profiles/simplonmidipyrenees

And the body :
```json
{
  "links" : [
  		"https://www.codecademy.com/javaMaster49518",
  		"https://www.codecademy.com/fr/Sydjex",
  		"https://www.codecademy.com/LoubnaB",
  		"https://www.codecademy.com/boardAce96418"
  		]
}
```

## Get profiles
To get the list of profiles from a promo, a simple GET request to
> http://badgebusters.simplon.xyz/api/profiles/{promoName}.

The response will be an array with profiles :
```json
